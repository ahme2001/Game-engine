# Game-engine
implement a generic game engine for drawing game boards. The engine will support drawing four games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4, Checkers and Chess, however, it should be extensible to draw any other board game (e.g., Go Game).
The engine will have only two responsibilities: 
1.Drawing the board and pieces
2.Enforce the rules of moving pieces
The engine will NOT 
1.Have intelligence for playing against the player
2.Check the winner, or calculate the scores
3.Save/Load the game status
